#### Issues

- Context REALLY does matter (Screen content & resolution)
  - Bitrates are only useful in a relative comparison
  - Even relative diff might change with different contents
  - Not really useful for real world storage usage estimations!!!
  - No consistency check if the browser actually did the very same thing every time
    - A static video playback or even transcoding from a raw capture might've been better
- Encoding framework and containers might favor one codec
  - Use a container format supported by all codecs

#### Things to keep in mind

- Fast moving targets
  - Especially AV1
  - Results might not hold up for long
